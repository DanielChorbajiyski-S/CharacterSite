        <h3>Section 4: Quotes</h3>
        <p>This is how Rimuru explaines what his goal is:</p>
        <blockquote><strong>"It's simple. I want to create a world where life is as convenient as I wish it to be. A comfortable world where everyone can laugh and enjoy their lives as much as possible. That's what I truly and honestly want.
          Ideals without power are nonsense, and power without ideals is empty, right? I'm a greedy guy, but I don't have an interest in seeking power just for the sake of power, without the ambition to do something with it."</strong></blockquote>
